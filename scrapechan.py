ABOUT:


    This script scrapes 4chan board catalogs for thread titles/teasers,
    uses a blacklist of phrases to determine the amount/percentage of zoomer/boomer/brainlet threads,
    and returns that as a string to stdout


    Usage: $ python3 scrapechan.py [board name]
    i.e.   $ python3 scrapechan.py g
           $ python3 scrapechan.py wg


    Running with no board argument will default to /g/
    Add any phrases or words that you want to filter to the lists, below
    Pay attention to the format of the phrase though, example:
        Adding "phone" will cause a post with 'microphone' to be deemed bad, however
        adding " phone " (spaces surrounding) will only do so if the word phone (by
        itself) is in the thread title
    This could all just be done with regexes probably, but it's already done, so...


    I use this in my i3bar to see whether or not /g/ is even worth checking (it's not)
    If you are using i3blocks:

        # /g/ thread analyzer
        [absolute_state]
        label=/g/ Brainlet Meter
        interval=once
        command=echo $(python3 /path/to/executable/scrapechan.py)
        separator=true
